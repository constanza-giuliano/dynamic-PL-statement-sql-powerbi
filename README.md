# Dynamic P&L Statement

Interactive **P&L Statement** built in **Power BI** with dynamic financial logic, including **gross vs net analysis**, **ARS/USD currency switching**, **$ / % views**, and **total vs average periods**. Designed with reusable **DAX measures**, secure data handling, and a focus on accurate **financial analysis** and business decision-making.

## Context
A construction company required a flexible P&L dashboard to analyze financial performance across different periods, currencies, and aggregation levels. The solution needed to support management analysis while maintaining strong control over data accuracy and integrity.

## Objectives
- Build a dynamic **P&L Statement**
- Enable **vertical** and **horizontal analysis**
- Allow switching between **ARS / USD**
- Allow switching between **$ / %**
- Allow **Total vs Average** of selected months
- Ensure **data integrity** (no manual modification)
